**Learning Activities & Resources**

- Explored starter themes for WordPress: [Underscores (\_s)](http://underscores.me), [Understrap](https://understrap.com),
  and [Sage](https://roots.io/sage).
- Learned alternative PHP control structures (`endif;`, `endforeach;`) for better readability.
- Used **PHPStorm** tools: File Watcher for Sass, "Find in Path" for debugging, and the "show-current-template" plugin.
- Updated `functions.php` to add menu locations, update styles, and customize page layouts.

  **Learning Experiment**
