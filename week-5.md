**Week 5**

**Learning Activities & Resources**  
This week, I focused on learning about child themes in WordPress. I explored the concept of child themes and their
importance in customizing WordPress websites without affecting the original theme. Key resources included:

- [WordPressâ€™s official documentation on child themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/)
- [YouTube tutorial on creating and customizing a child theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpwp_BIXMg)

**Estimated Hours**  
I spent around 4 hours this week learning about child themes, reviewing documentation, and customizing my website.

**Content Insights**
This week, I learned that child themes are essential for safely modifying a WordPress theme, as they allow for theme updates
without losing custom changes. Creating a child theme also gives more flexibility to experiment with CSS and PHP modifications.
Practicing with child themes helped me gain confidence in customizing WordPress sites and using theme files effectively.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
Learning about child themes is an important skill for anyone in web development, especially for creating customizable, updatable
WordPress sites for clients. The ability to manage and customize themes while protecting the original theme files enhances the
quality of my work and expands my capabilities as a developer. Mastering these skills also makes me more adaptable to client
needs and industry standards.
