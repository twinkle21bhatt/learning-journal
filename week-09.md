**Week-09**

**Learning Activities & Resources**
This week, I focused on learning and implementing Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) to improve my CSS workflow.
I created a simple new website to demonstrate Sass features and set up an automated workflow using Gulp. The website is original and not based on a tutorial.  

**Sass Features Used:**
1. *Variables:* Defined reusable variables for colors and font sizes to ensure consistency.  
2. *Nesting:* Used nested selectors to structure the CSS hierarchically, reducing repetitive code.  
3. *Mixins:* Created mixins for reusable style blocks, such as buttons and card layouts.  
4. *Extend/Inheritance:* Applied inheritance to share common styles among multiple elements, reducing redundancy.  

I also discussed my group project with my team in class and on Slack. We planned tasks and shared updates on our individual contributions.  

**Estimated Hours**
- 3 hours building the website and writing Sass.  
- 1 hour setting up the Gulp workflow for automating CSS compilation.  
- 2 hours discussing our group project.  
- *Total:* 6 hours.  

**Content Insights**
- Sass variables simplify maintaining consistent styles across the website.  
- Nesting and inheritance reduce redundancy, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.  
- Automated workflows like Gulp speed up development by auto-compiling SCSS files into CSS.  
- Discussing tasks and progress with group members helped in staying aligned and productive.  

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
This weekâ€™s work enhanced my skills in front-end development and CSS pre-processing,
both of which are valuable in modern web development. Learning how to implement an automated
workflow not only improved efficiency but also gave me practical experience in tools used in the industry. 
Collaborating with my team also improved my teamwork and communication skills.
