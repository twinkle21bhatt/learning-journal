**Week 4**

**Learning Activities & Resources**  
This week in class, we discussed the requirements and structure for our final assignment, which involves creating two CMS-based websitesâ€”one
in Joomla and one in WordPress.We also focused on deployment concepts, specifically the three stages of deployment, which are crucial for
establishing a reliable workflow in web development. These stages include:

- **Local**: The initial development environment where code and design are tested locally on a personal machine.
- **Staging**: A test environment that closely resembles the production setup, used to finalize changes and detect potential issues.
- **Production**: The live environment where the website is publicly accessible to users.

Understanding these stages and the importance of setting up multiple environments helps create a stable, organized workflow that reduces errors and ensures quality.

**Estimated Hours**
I spent about 8 hours this week (4 hours on class discussions and 4 hours starting on Assignment 1), learning about deployment environments and beginning
work on my Joomla and WordPress websites.

**Content Insights**  
This week, I gained insight into the deployment process and the critical role that multiple environments play in website development.
Understanding the workflow of local, staging, and production environments will help me structure my projects in a more organized manner,
reducing the risk of errors in live environments. Additionally, I started work on Assignment 1,
exploring Joomla and WordPress to understand the setup process, which provided hands-on experience with two popular CMS platforms.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Learning about deployment stages has prepared me to create and manage web projects effectively, a skill that is highly valued in the
tech industry. By establishing a good workflow across different environments, I am developing a more professional approach to web
development, enhancing both the quality of my work and my employability. Starting on the assignment also gave me valuable experience
with Joomla and WordPress, expanding my versatility and adaptability as a developer.
