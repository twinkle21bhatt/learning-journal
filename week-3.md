### Week 3

**Learning Activities & Resources**  
This week, I downloaded and installed WordPress locally to explore its features. I looked through the interface and compared it to Joomla,
learning about its simplicity in managing content. We also had class discussions about forming project groups and prepared questions for
an upcoming visitor to help us with our group project.

- Class discussion on group formation and project planning.

**Estimated Hours**  
I spent approximately 3 hours this week on learning WordPress and class discussions.

**Content Insights**  
I learned how WordPress simplifies content management compared to Joomla. Its interface is easier to use, especially for beginners, and
offers a wide variety of plugins for additional features. This understanding will help me decide which CMS to use based on project needs.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Exploring WordPress showed me the importance of knowing multiple content management systems, as different projects or clients may have
specific platform preferences. The group formation discussions also helped me realize how critical it is to work effectively in a team,
especially in managing different expectations and roles.
