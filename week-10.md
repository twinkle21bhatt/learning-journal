 **Week 10**

**Learning Activities & Resources**  
This week, I focused on preparing for our upcoming presentation. I conducted a "tech check" to ensure that my laptop worked with the presentation
equipment and practiced our group presentation multiple times. This included running through our slides, testing the microphones, and checking the video and audio quality.  

**Activities Completed:**  
1. **Tech Check:**  
   - Tested my laptop.
   - Verified the quality of the microphone, camera, and lighting.  
   - Ensured the presentation was visible and clear for the audience.  

2. **Rehearsals:**  
   - Ran through the presentation three times with my group.  
   - After each rehearsal, we used the assignment rubric to evaluate ourselves.  
   - Identified and improved gaps in the flow, content, and delivery of the presentation.  
   - Adjusted the timing to match the duration requirements.  

3. **Demonstration Practice:**  
   - Planned a realistic demonstration to include in the presentation.  
   - Practiced delivering the demo clearly and concisely to ensure it aligned with the rest of the presentation.  

**Estimated Hours**  
- 1 hour for the tech check.  
- 3 hours for rehearsals and feedback sessions.  
- 1 hour for finalizing the demonstration.  
- **Total:** 5 hours.  

**Content Insights**  
- Rehearsing helped identify gaps in transitions between speakers and refine slide content.  
- Using the rubric provided a clear structure to evaluate our strengths and weaknesses.  
- Planning a realistic demo added value to our presentation and made it more engaging.  

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
- This week strengthened my ability to deliver effective presentations, a skill essential for professional settings.  
- Practicing with a team improved coordination and highlighted the importance of feedback in achieving a polished delivery.  
- Learning to adapt based on feedback is a valuable skill that I can apply in future team-based projects and presentations.  

**Reflection**  
Overall, this week was productive in terms of preparing for the presentation. The rehearsals gave me confidence and clarity about my part of the presentation.
Working collaboratively with my team also improved our overall cohesion and readiness.
