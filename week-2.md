**Week 2**

**Learning Activities & Resources**  
This week, I worked with Joomla CMS, setting it up on my local server using localhost and creating an account to explore its functionality.
I also tried online web hosting using SiteGround and Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, I encountered several difficulties during the process.
Transitioning from local hosting to online web hosting was more challenging than expected, and I struggled to use some of Joomla's editing features.

**Estimated Hours**  
I spent around 9 hours this week (3 hours for 3 days), focusing on Joomla CMS setup, local hosting, and attempting to host
my website using SiteGround and AWS.

**Content Insights**  
This week provided valuable lessons in CMS installation and local hosting with Joomla.
I also explored online web hosting through SiteGround and AWS, but I encountered issues with navigating the hosting setup,
especially with transitioning from local to online environments.Additionally, I found Joomla’s editing tools difficult to
use and less intuitive than expected. These challenges have highlighted the need for further learning in both CMS features
and online hosting environments.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
While I faced difficulties this week, the experience helped me build resilience in solving technical problems. Working with
SiteGround and AWS has given me some exposure to popular hosting platforms, which are essential for web development.
Although I struggled with Joomla’s editing features, understanding the limitations and complexities of different platforms
will ultimately enhance my problem-solving abilities and adaptability—key skills for a career in web development.
